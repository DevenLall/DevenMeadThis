This is a test website that i want to create. it will be like a blog posting for a wine fermenting community that i want to build. it will have a database(mongodb), mfa otp (gmail api) and some other things ill need to think about.

users will sign up and create an account, users can post stuff about wine fermenting or comment on other posts about wine fermenting.
